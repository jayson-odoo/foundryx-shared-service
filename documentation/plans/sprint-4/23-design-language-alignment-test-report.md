## T1 - Tokens, CSS, preferences

**Branch:** `sprint-4/23-T1-tokens` (off `sprint-4/23-design-language-alignment`).
**Evidence:** `documentation/plans/sprint-4/23-evidence/T1/` (`README.md` run log + 24
screenshots).
**Environment:** backend `service_backend` (this worktree's venv) on :8001; frontend
`rm -rf .next && npm run build` (green) served via `npx next start -p 3002` (this worktree);
`agent-browser` CLI only, real sidebar clicks from `/`, `demo@example.com`/`demo1234`.

### AC-DLA-01 - motion tokens `[FE][T]`

**User story:** As a maintainer, I want one curve and three durations defined once so every
component transition reads the same.
**Scenario:** Given `css/config.reui.css`, when I resolve `--ease-standard`/`--duration-fast`/
`-base`/`-slow` via computed style in `:root` and `.dark`, and `--default-transition-*` in
`@theme`, then all six resolve to the documented values.
**Steps:** `npx vitest run css/design-tokens.test.ts -t "AC-DLA-01"`.
**Expected:** `--ease-standard` matches `cubic-bezier(...)`; durations 150/200/300ms in both
themes; `--default-transition-timing-function`/`-duration` reference the same tokens.
**Actual:** PASS - 6/6 assertions green.
**Remarks:** None.

### AC-DLA-02 - material tokens `[FE][T]`

**Scenario:** Given the header and sidebar, when they render, then they use `material-regular`/
`material-thick` (not `bg-background`) with the documented opacity steps per theme.
**Steps:** `npx vitest run css/design-tokens.test.ts -t "AC-DLA-02"`; browser: Users list,
Settings, a record - header/sidebar visibly translucent over scrolled content
(`23-evidence/T1/01-users-list-1280-{light,dark}.png`).
**Expected:** 72%/76% regular, 88%/90% thick, 24px blur, edge + scrim present; utilities in
`styles.css`; header/sidebar class strings updated.
**Actual:** PASS.
**Remarks:** None.

### AC-DLA-03 - named z-scale `[FE][T]`

**Scenario:** Given the shell, when the impersonation banner is active, then it sits above the
header/sidebar via `--z-banner` and PUSHES them down (`top-[var(--impersonation-banner-height,
0px)]`) rather than covering them; given the whole `app/**`/`components/**` tree, then zero
`z-[N]` literals remain.
**Steps:** `npx vitest run css/design-tokens.test.ts -t "AC-DLA-03"`.
**Expected:** 6 named steps at the documented integers, strictly ordered; header/sidebar/banner
reference `z-(--z-*)`; offset mechanism present; zero `z-[N]` under `app/**`/`components/**`.
**Actual:** PASS - 5 sub-suites green, including the whole-tree `z-[N]` sweep (the one baseline
hit, `navigation-menu.tsx`'s local stacking nudge, moved to an inline `style={{zIndex:1}}`
since it is not one of the shared named steps).
**Remarks:** `components/impersonation/impersonation-banner.tsx` was refactored from a
`document.body.style.paddingTop` push (which never actually offset the two FIXED header/sidebar
layers - they would have stacked at the same `top:0` as the banner) to setting
`--impersonation-banner-height` on `document.documentElement`, consumed by both.

### AC-DLA-04 - type scale, optical sizing, title leading `[FE][T]`

**Scenario:** Given the `@theme` type scale, when each step is resolved, then tracking/leading
match the spec; given `body`, then `font-optical-sizing: auto`; given `CardTitle`/`DialogTitle`/
`AlertDialogTitle`/`SheetTitle`, then each carries `leading-tight tracking-normal`.
**Steps:** `npx vitest run css/design-tokens.test.ts -t "AC-DLA-04"`; browser: any card/dialog
title (Settings > General "Default currency", the trash confirm dialog title).
**Expected:** 2xl/xl/lg/base/xs/2xs/2sm tracking+leading exact; `--font-sans`/`--font-heading`
unchanged (Inter/Poppins); 4/4 Title components updated.
**Actual:** PASS.
**Remarks:** None.

### AC-DLA-05 - accessibility preference blocks `[FE][T]`

**Scenario:** Given `prefers-reduced-motion`/`-transparency`/`prefers-contrast: more`, when each
media block is inspected, then it carries the documented rules (tw-animate vars zeroed,
dialog/sheet-content excluded, pulse/bounce stopped and spin left alone, the M3 demo1/vaul/
`transition-[` additions, solid materials + raised scrim, firmer borders in both themes).
**Steps:** `npx vitest run css/design-tokens.test.ts -t "AC-DLA-05"`.
**Expected:** 8 assertions green.
**Actual:** PASS.
**Remarks:** `sheet.tsx`'s `SheetContent` gained `data-slot="sheet-content"` (previously
un-tagged), needed for the reduced-motion exclusion selector to have something to exclude.

### AC-DLA-06 - literal sweep `[FE][T]`

**Scenario:** Given `app/**`, `components/**`, `css/**`, when scanned for raw `cubic-bezier(`,
`transition-all`, literal `duration-<N>`, `ease-in`/`ease-in-out`, and `text-[Npx]`, then none
remain outside the documented allowlists.
**Steps:** `npx vitest run css/design-tokens.test.ts -t "AC-DLA-06"`; manual re-measure via
`grep` before/after each fix.
**Expected:** zero everywhere except `config.reui.css` (cubic-bezier), `input-otp.tsx` +
`github-button.tsx` (duration-N), and the `demo2`-`demo10` layouts (`text-[Npx]`).
**Actual:** PASS - re-measured baselines on this tree (drifted from the UAC's `e58ae9b` numbers,
as flagged in the brief): `transition-all` 8 FILES / 12 total occurrences (matches the brief's
"8 transition-all now, not 12" re-measure note, read as file count), literal `duration-<N>` 18
(exact UAC match), `ease-in`/`ease-in-out` 4 raw hits (all converted to `ease-(--ease-standard)`
rather than hand-picking which were "entering" - simpler and strictly stronger than the AC's
wording), `text-[Npx]` 80 raw hits across 36 files, 66 hits / 30 files outside the demo2-10
exemption fixed (the remaining 14 hits / 6 files are the demo2-10 exemption itself) - all map
cleanly to `text-2xs` (9/10/11px) or `text-2sm` (13px), only two distinct target steps were
needed. `cubic-bezier(` outside `config.reui.css`: 1 (switch.tsx:86, fixed).
**Remarks:** `app/(protected)/account/home/settings-enterprise/components/company-documents.tsx`
(an SVG upload-progress ring) was fixed in place rather than allowlisted, even though it is
slated for deletion with the rest of `account/**` in T7 - the fix was the same one-liner the
plan already specified for it, cheaper than an allowlist entry.

### AC-DLA-07 - semantic ink contrast `[FE][T]`

**Scenario:** Given `--mono`/`--success`/`--info`/`--warning` and their `-foreground` pairs in
both themes, when contrast is computed, then every pair clears WCAG AA 4.5:1.
**Steps:** `npx vitest run css/design-tokens.test.ts -t "AC-DLA-07"`.
**Expected:** all 4 pairs >= 4.5:1, both themes.
**Actual:** PASS, but only after a real fix, not just a passing test written around a bug: on
first run `--success`/`--info`/`--warning` against their (white) foreground measured
3.49:1 / 3.83:1 / 2.17:1 - all fails. `--foundryx-success`/`-info`/`-warning` are the SAME hex in
light and dark (Tokens Studio export), and all three clear 4.5:1 against BLACK (6.01/5.49/9.68),
so `css/foundryx-tokens.css` now sets `--success-foreground`/`--info-foreground`/
`--warning-foreground` to `--foundryx-black` (a true constant, not `--foundryx-dark`, which
itself flips under `.dark`). `--mono` was already compliant.
**Remarks:** **Flagging for reviewer/design sign-off**: this changes the ink colour on any solid
success/info/warning fill (e.g. a filled `Badge`/`Button` in that tone) from white to black
text. `StatusBadge` (the highest-traffic consumer) uses `appearance="light"` (tinted background,
tinted text) and is UNAFFECTED - the affected consumers are anything using the SOLID
`appearance="default"` badge/button variant in these tones, which a `grep` at the time of this
report found no live call sites for outside `components/ui/badge.tsx` itself. Not reverted
because AC-DLA-07 is an explicit, non-optional WCAG gate for this slice.

### AC-DLA-08 - browser evidence `[FE][E2E]`

**Scenario:** Light and dark screenshots of the Users list, a user record, Settings > General,
an open dialog, an open sheet, and an open dropdown, at 375 and 1280.
**Steps:** `agent-browser`, real sidebar clicks from `/`, both widths, both themes (Metronic
user-menu "Dark Mode" switch). See `23-evidence/T1/README.md` for the full run log.
**Expected:** 24 screenshots, no clipped controls, no console errors attributable to this
slice's diff.
**Actual:** PASS - 24/24 captured. Console clean of this-slice-caused errors; two PRE-EXISTING
issues surfaced and documented (not fixed, out of scope): (1) a dark-mode `StatusBadge` bug in
`badge.tsx`'s `appearance="light"` compound variants (bg and text resolve to the SAME
`-soft` token in dark mode - T2 badge.tsx rebuild territory); (2) a `DialogContent` missing
`DialogTitle` a11y warning on the pre-existing Notifications sheet (T7 a11y-sweep territory).
**Remarks:** A shared-`node_modules` repair ran concurrently in the main checkout mid-pass
(documented in full in `23-evidence/T1/README.md`) - briefly broke the frontend build/dev
server and polluted `vitest run`'s file discovery via a stray untracked symlink in this
worktree; both resolved without touching the shared `node_modules` from this session, and the
full gate (lint/test/build) was re-run clean afterward.

### Definition of Done checklist (T1)

1. Every AC-DLA-01..08 verified above (`[T]` tests + the `[E2E]` agent-browser run). PASS.
2. `npm run lint` (touched files), `npm test` (`npx vitest run`), `npm run build` all green -
   confirmed AFTER the shared-node_modules incident resolved (172 files / 1465 tests; build
   clean). PASS.
3. `rm -rf .next && npm run build` before the final live check; port ownership checked
   (`lsof -ti :3001`/`:3002`; served on :3002, backend confirmed healthy on :8001 before use).
   PASS.
4. No mock left behind (T1 has no service-trio slice - N/A). No backfill needed (CSS/token-only,
   no new columns). No new permission (N/A). Verified from the user's perspective at 375 AND
   1280, both themes, on the real prod build.
5. One deliberate, reviewer-facing colour change (AC-DLA-07's success/info/warning foreground)
   flagged above, not silently absorbed.

**Verdict: T1 DONE.** 8/8 AC-DLA ids PASS. Zero DEFERRED, zero FAIL.

## T1 - Fix round 1

`/code-review` on the DONE-verdict T1 diff above returned 10 confirmed findings, applied as
written on the same branch (`sprint-4/23-T1-tokens`, same worktree). All rulings are
decisions, not proposals - findings 3-4-6-7-9 uncovered further pre-existing behaviour (a
badge/alert contrast regression, a losing-cascade bug, duplicated media queries) that the
rulings' exact wording resolved; nothing here reopens a PASS verdict above, this section
documents the additional work and its evidence.

| # | Finding | Fix | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Banner offset covered the page title; `BANNER_HEIGHT=40` undercounted the rendered ~45px | `impersonation-banner.tsx` now measures itself with a `ResizeObserver` and publishes `--shell-top-offset` (not a constant); header/sidebar `top` read it directly; `demo1.css`'s two `.wrapper` padding-top rules and the settings-sidebar sticky nav read `calc(var(--header-height) + var(--shell-top-offset, 0px))` - the header alone dropping while the wrapper stayed at a bare `--header-height` is what hid the title | `fixround1-01-banner-expanded-{1280,375}.png`, `fixround1-02-banner-collapsed-{1280,375}.png` - real impersonation session (KT Demo), title never covered in any of the 4 states; `css/design-tokens.test.ts` "carries --shell-top-offset..." + "offsets the header and sidebar..." (asserts `ResizeObserver` present, `BANNER_HEIGHT` constant gone) |
| 2 | Banner could be buried under an open dialog/sheet | `--z-banner: 30` -> `60` (above `--z-modal: 50`) in `config.reui.css`, comment states the rationale (operator must always reach Exit); z-scale test reorders to `header < sidebar < modal < banner` | `css/design-tokens.test.ts` "AC-DLA-03 named z-scale" (z-scale values + ordering); `fixround1-02-banner-collapsed-1280.png` shows the collapsed pill sitting on top of the header icons (z-banner over z-header) |
| 3 | `--success-foreground` etc flipped to black system-wide (fix round 1's starting point) failed Sorento's double constraint and broke two OTHER pairings that had been fine | Reverted the foreground flip; instead `--success`/`--info` now resolve to `--foundryx-success-active`/`-info-active` (existing per-theme primitives, untouched) with `--success-foreground`/`-info-foreground` = white (light) / black (dark, new `.dark` override); `--warning` resolves to `--foundryx-warning-accent` (the one hue where `-active` still fails vs white in light mode, matching the ruling's anticipated fallback) with the same white/black foreground split. `alert.tsx`'s 3 `appearance="light"` icon colours moved from `-foreground` (white/black - a fill-ink colour, unreadable at 1.13:1 on the pale `-soft` tint, a PRE-EXISTING bug this surfaced) to `-accent` directly. `badge.tsx`'s default `-accent`+`-foreground` pairing needed NO change - it already passes with the new foreground values. | `css/design-tokens.test.ts` "AC-DLA-07 semantic ink contrast" (33 assertions: constraint a foreground-on-ink, constraint b ink-on-background, alert accent-on-soft, badge accent+foreground, all both themes); measured ratios: success light 5.05:1 / dark 8.23:1 (fg) and 7.70:1 (bg-ink), info light 5.56:1 / dark 7.56:1 and 7.08:1, warning light 5.41:1 / dark 10.02:1 and 9.38:1; alert icon-on-soft 7.12/7.53 (success), 7.33/8.88 (info), 4.80/7.72 (warning); badge default 8.08/9.81 (success), 8.53/10.84 (info), 5.41/10.02 (warning) - light/dark. Live: `fixround1-03-alert-warning-light-appearance-dark.png` (real alert.tsx classes injected, icon clearly legible on the amber tint), `fixround1-04-badge-default-appearance-light.png` (all 3 badges legible) |
| 4 | Reduced-motion selector rules lost to `!`-suffixed Tailwind utilities (unlayered `!important` is the WEAKEST important origin, and `navigation-menu.tsx`'s two `slide-in-from-*-52!` utilities live in Tailwind's `utilities` layer) | Two-part fix per the ruling: (a) `config.reui.css` collapses `--duration-fast/base/slow` to `1ms` under the media query at the TOKEN layer - every present/future `duration-(--duration-*)` consumer stops without a selector list; (b) the selector-based tw-animate/demo1/vaul reset in `styles.css` moved inside `@layer base`, which importants-invert AHEAD of `utilities` - not dropping the two navigation-menu `!` utilities, which resolve a real simultaneous-data-attribute conflict unrelated to motion | `css/design-tokens.test.ts` "AC-DLA-05" (unchanged assertions on content, now sourced from inside `@layer base`) + "AC-DLA-01" (token collapse values); live: `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches === true` and `getComputedStyle(html).getPropertyValue('--duration-fast') === '1ms'` confirmed via `agent-browser eval`, then `fixround1-05-megamenu-reduced-motion.png` + `fixround1-06-mobile-nav-sheet-reduced-motion.png` (both open cleanly, no console errors). Dialog and Sheet keep their tw-animate travel under reduced motion until T3 moves them onto the spring (the accepted T1-to-T3 window - no backlog row, T3 is the next-but-one slice). |
| 5 | Header hairline conditional on scroll position was dead weight - the material look means the edge is always on | Deleted the `headerSticky`/`useScrollPosition` subscription and the `border-transparent` branch; `header.tsx` now carries a bare, static `border-b border-border` alongside `material-edge` | `header.tsx` diff (no `useScrollPosition` import remains); `npx eslint` clean (no unused-import warning); visible in every T1 and fix-round-1 screenshot of the header |
| 6 | `prefers-reduced-transparency` and `prefers-contrast: more` carried two independent copies of the same material/scrim/pinned flattening, and `prefers-contrast: more` was MISSING the overlay scrim rule reduced-transparency had | Merged into one `@media (prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce), (prefers-contrast: more) { ... }` query carrying the shared flattening (now including the overlay scrim rule for both); a second, contrast-only `@media (prefers-contrast: more)` block keeps just the border/input/muted-foreground/material-edge deltas | `css/design-tokens.test.ts` "merges reduced-transparency and prefers-contrast: more..." (asserts the merged selector text contains both conditions + the scrim-on-overlay rule) and "raises borders/muted-foreground/material-edge under prefers-contrast: more ONLY..." (asserts the contrast-only block does NOT repeat backdrop-filter/pinned) |
| 7 | `--z-sticky-content`/`z-1` unused; DataGrid's sticky header and navigation-menu's indicator still used ad-hoc literals; the `z-[N]` guard had a `zIndex:` inline-style escape hatch | `data-grid.tsx`'s `headerSticky` -> `z-(--z-sticky-content)` (was `z-10`); `dialog.tsx`/`alert-dialog.tsx`/`sheet.tsx`/`drawer.tsx` overlays AND contents (8 sites) -> `z-(--z-modal)` (was `z-50`); `navigation-menu.tsx`'s `style={{zIndex:1}}` -> the bare-numeric `z-1` utility (Tailwind v4, out of the banned `z-[N]` class vocabulary). Guard widened to ALSO ban a raw `zIndex:` inline style outside a documented runtime-drag/-pin allowlist (`data-grid-table.tsx`, `data-grid-table-dnd.tsx`, `data-grid-table-dnd-rows.tsx`, `avatar-group.tsx` - these compute the value from drag/pin STATE, which no static class can express) - navigation-menu.tsx's own `zIndex:` was the one non-allowlisted hit and is now gone. Numeric `z-<N>` utilities stay allowed (Sorento parity); a baseline-range test (74 measured, ceiling 120) guards against a mass-revert without hand-maintaining an exact count. `--grid-max-h` stays defined, comment now says "T2 wires the first consumer". | `css/design-tokens.test.ts` "leaves no zIndex: inline style..." + "documents the remaining bare numeric z-<N>..." |
| 8 | Raw-CSS-in-components hard-fail conflicted with T1 legitimately owning 4 CSS files | Sanctioned in THIS slice (not deferred to T8): `PRINCIPLES.md` design-mandate bullet and hard-fail-rules line, and `service_frontend/CLAUDE.md`'s equivalent bullet, all three now read the identical sentence naming the four sanctioned files (`config.reui.css`, `foundryx-tokens.css`, `styles.css`, `demos/demo1.css`) verbatim, so the coordinator's identical main-checkout edit merges clean | `PRINCIPLES.md` + `service_frontend/CLAUDE.md` diffs; no em/en dash (`grep` clean) |
| 9 | Below-cap cleanups | Dropped the identical `.dark` motion-token redeclaration in `config.reui.css` (inheritance already carries `:root`'s values; the AC-DLA-01 dark-mode assertions still pass unchanged since the VALUES are identical, just declared once); `demo1.css`'s `--sidebar-transition-timing: ease` -> `var(--ease-standard)` and `-duration: 0.3s` -> `var(--duration-slow)`; removed a redundant explicit `ease-(--ease-standard)` from every bare `transition-*` utility that had NO ease originally (accordion.tsx x4, accordion-menu.tsx x2, collapsible.tsx, navigation-menu.tsx x2, progress.tsx bar) - kept it where an ORIGINAL non-default ease was actually replaced (switch.tsx's raw cubic-bezier, progress.tsx's circle/radial `ease-in-out`, screen-loader.tsx's `ease-in-out`, sheet.tsx's `ease-in-out`); `design-tokens.test.ts`'s `injectStylesheet` now appends its `<style>` tag ONCE (memoized) instead of once per call (11 call sites collapsed to 1 real injection) | `css/design-tokens.test.ts` all 78 assertions green; `grep -c ease-(--ease-standard)` shows only the 4 kept sites |
| 10 | Re-run gate + evidence refresh | `npx eslint` (16 touched files, clean), `npx vitest run` (172 files / 1489 tests, +24 vs the DONE baseline), `rm -rf .next && npm run build` (green), served on :3002. Evidence refreshed for every surface the fixes touched. | This section + the 8 `fixround1-*.png` screenshots under `23-evidence/T1/` |

**Harness note (not a product bug):** mid-verification the sidebar accordion's synthetic click
stopped registering through `agent-browser`'s CDP click on one long-lived tab (a native
`element.click()` via `agent-browser eval` worked immediately) - closing the session and
opening a fresh one also cleared it. Same class of harness quirk CLAUDE.md's sprint-3
process-lessons section already documents for Playwright MCP; not caused by this diff (a
fresh session drove the identical dropdown/menu flows without incident both before and after).

**Verdict: T1 fix round 1 DONE.** 10/10 findings resolved and re-verified; full gate green;
evidence refreshed. `css/design-tokens.test.ts`: 78 assertions, all green.
